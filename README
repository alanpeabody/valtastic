Valtastic 0.1

jQuery Validation plugin for Formtastic.

Validation for Formtastic that uses the same markup as Formtastic so you only have to style things once.

Gotcha: currently only supports the list format for errors, which you set in the formtastic initilizer.


Installation and Usage:

1. Include JQuery, Valtastic, and application.js

<%= javascript_include_tag 'jquery-1.4.2.min', 'rails', 'valtastic/jquery.valtastic', :cache => :jquery %>
<%= javascript_include_tag 'application', :cache => :application %>

2. In application.js

$(document).ready(function(){
  $('.formtastic').valtastic();
});

3. In config/initializers/formtastic.rb

Formtastic::SemanticFormBuilder.inline_errors = :list

(support for sentance structure coming soon)


4. Customization:

Valtastic performs validation based on the class name of the li surrounding the input field.

Every class name may have up to five rules. The rules are:

* required: checks that field is not empty.
* min_length: length that the field must be greater then or equal to.
* max_length: length that the field must be less then or equal to.
* regex: a javascript regular expression that the field must match.
* must_match: a string that will be evaluated as a jquery selector, used for password/email confirmations.

In addition you can pass in a message that will be displayed any of the validation rules fail.


The default options are the following:
{
  required: {
    required: true
  },
  email: {
    min_length: 6,
    regex: /^([\w-]+(?:\.[\w-]+)*)@((?:[\w-]+\.)*\w[\w-]{0,66})\.([a-z]{2,6}(?:\.[a-z]{2})?)$/i
  },
  password: {
    min_length: 6,
  },
  password_confirmation: {
    must_match: '#password',
    message: 'must match password',
  }
}
To override these options or add new ones simply pass your options to the valtastic method.

For example:

$(document).ready(function(){
  $('.formtastic').valtastic({
    username: {
      min_length: 5,
      regex: /^[A-Za-z0-9]$/,
      message: 'must be at least 5 characters and only contain numbers and letters',
    },
    password_confirmation: {
      must_match: '#user_password',
      message: 'must match password',
    }
  });
});
